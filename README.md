# Pokemon Gold - Web remake

This is the Game Boy game [Pokemon Gold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver "Wikipedia") from the 2000s remade into a web version using [Phaser](https://phaser.io) and a bunch of other tools that help creating the assets, like: [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org), [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) or [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org).

## Work in progress

The entire Pokemon's map, user interface and logic are huge.

This is a WIP and for now the available places are:

* Ethan's Bedroom

## Installation

For now it just requires you to get the code and serve the project from the root directory.

Personnaly I run `python3 -m http.server` and I'm good to go.

## Credits

Obiouvsly all credits goes to the creators of the original game: GAME FREAK Inc.
